          <h2>Strategic Investments</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          In addition to Bridger's primary service businesses, Bridger makes strategic
          investments on behalf of itself, its partners and clients. Bridger's Investments
          fall into two categories: programmatic and opportunistic. Bridger has
          institutional partners that identified Bridger as their regional investment
          platform, charging Bridger with executing those strategies. Bridger's
          opportunistic investments are the result of its unique presence in the market
          and are more situational in nature. Bridger invests in all asset classes and in
          all areas of the capital stack.
